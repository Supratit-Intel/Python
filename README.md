# Python Algorithms Collection

This repository is a collection of standalone Python implementations for common algorithms and data structures. Each algorithm is implemented in its own script and accompanied by a small example under `if __name__ == '__main__'` where useful.

The repo is organized by topic folders:

- `Dynamic Programming/` — DP algorithms (Knapsack, LCS, LIS, Matrix Chain,...)
- `Graphs/` — graph traversal and pathfinding (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra...)
- `Searching/` — searching algorithms (Binary Search, Jump Search, Interpolation, etc.)
- `Sorting/` — classic sorting algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, etc.)
- `Strings/` — string algorithms (KMP, Rabin-Karp, Z, Manacher...)
- `Others/` — assorted algorithms: BST, Union-Find, Kadane, Sieve, Backtracking helpers, Huffman, etc.
